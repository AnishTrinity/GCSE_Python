#CONSTANTS EXPLAINED

#CONSTANTS LOOK A BIT LIKE VARIABLES

#BUT CONSTANTS ARE DECLARED IN FULL CAPS

#for example

THREEPOINTSHOT = 3
FREE_THROWS = 1

#WHEN PROGRAMMERS SEE A CONSTANT

#IT TELLS THEM NOT TO CHANGE THE VALUE

#TO DISPLAY THE VALUE IN THE CONSTANT, THE CODE IS:

print(THREEPOINTSHOT)
