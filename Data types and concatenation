#It is possible to do maths with Floats and Integers
#It is not possible to do mathis with strings or characters
#example

num1 = "20" #string
num2 = "31" #string
total = num1 + num2
print(total)

#You cannot add strings or characters
#Instead the add symbol glues them together
#But we don't call it glue, we call it concatenation
